- Once we create an object, compulsory we should perform initialization then only the object is in a position to respond properly.
- Whenever we are creating an object some piece of the code will be executed automatically to perform initialization of the obejct. This piece of the code is nothing but constructor.
- Hence the main purpose of constructor is to perform initialization of an object.

e.g.
class Student
{
    String name;
    int rollno;

    Student(String name, int rollno)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.name = rollno;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Student s1 = new Student("priya", 10);
        Student s2 = new Student("Zain", 11);
    }
}

# Note: The main purpose of constructor is to perform initialization of an object but not to create object.

# Difference between constructor and instance block:
- The main purpose of constructor is to perform initialization of an object.
- But other than initialization, if we want to perform any activity for every object creation then we should go for instance block (like updating one entry in the database for every object creation or incrementing count value for every object creation, etc.).
- Both constructor and instance block will be executed for every object creation but instance block first followed by constructor.

e.g.

class Test
{
    static int count = 0;

    {
        count++;
    }

    Test()
    {

    }

    Test(int i)
    {

    }

    Test(double d)
    {

    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Test t1 = new Test();
        Test t2 = new Test(10);
        Test t3 = new Test(10.5);
        System.out.println("The no. of objects creaated: ", count);
    }
}

# Rules of writing constructor:
1. name of the class and name of the constructor must be matched.
2. Return type concept not applicable for constructor even void also.
3. We won't get any compile time error if we decalred a constructor with a return type because compiler treat it as a method.   
4. Hence it is legal (but not recommanded) to have a method name exactly same as class name.
5. The only applicable modifiers for constructor are public, private, protected and default. If we are trying to use any other modifier we will get compile time error.


# Default constructor:
- Compiler is responsible to generate default constructor (but not JVM).
- If we are not writing any constructor then only compiler will generate default constructor i.e. if we are writing at least one constructor then compiler won't generate default constructor. Hence every class in Java can contain constructor. It may be default constructor generated by complier or constumized constructor explicitly provided by programmer but not both simultaneously.

# Prototype of default constructor:
- It is always no-arg constructor.
- The access modifier of default constructor is exactly same as access modifier of class. (this rule is applicable only for public and default)
- It contains only one line (super();).
- It is a no-argument call to super class constructor.

1. e.g.
programmer's code:
class Test
{

}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}

2. 
programmer's code:
class Test
{

}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}

2. 
programmer's code:
class Test
{

}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}

2. 
programmer's code:
class Test
{

}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}

2. 
programmer's code:
class Test
{

}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}
- It is always no-arg constructor.
- The access modifier of default constructor is exactly same as access modifier of class. (this rule is applicable only for public and default)
- It contains only one line (super();).
- It is a no-argument call to super class constructor.

1. e.g.
programmer's code:
class Test
{

}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}

2. 
programmer's code:
public class Test
{

}

compiler's code:
public class Test
{
    public Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}

3. 
programmer's code:
public class Test
{
    void Test()
    {

    }
}

compiler's code:
public class Test
{
    public Test()
    {
        super();
    }
    void Test()
    {
        
    }
}

4. 
programmer's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {

    }
}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
    }
}

5. 
programmer's code:
class Test
{   
    Test()
    {
        this(10);
    }
    Test(int i)
    {

    }
}

compiler's code:
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        this(10);
    }
    Test(int i)
    {
        super();
    }
}

- The first line inside every constructor should be either super() or this() and if we are not writing anything then compiler will always place super();

case 1:
- we can take super() or this() only in first line of constructor. If we are trying to take anywhere else we will get compile time error.
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        System.out.println("hey");
        super();
    }
} // CE: call to super must be first statement in constructor


case 2:
- Within a constructor we can take either super() or this() but not both simultaneously.
class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        super();
        this();
    }
} // CE: call to this must be first statement in constructor


case 3:
- we can use super() or this() only inside constructor. 
class Test
{
    public void mi()
    {
        super();
        System.out.println("hey");
    }
} // CE: call to super must be first statement in constructor

# super() and this():
- We can use only in constructor.
- Only in first line.
- Only one but not both simultaneously.

# super(), this()                                                  |   super, this
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. These are constructor calls to call super class and current         These are keywords to refer super class and currect class instance 
class constructors.                                                    method.

2. we can use only in constructors as first line.                      we can use anywhere except static area.

3. we can use only once in constructor                                 we can use any number of times.


# overloaded constructors:
- within a class, we can declare multiple constructors and all these constructors having same name but different type of arguments hence all these constructrs considered as overloaded constructors.
- Hence overloading concept applicable for constructors.

class Test
{
    Test()
    {
        this(10);
        System.out.println("no-arg");
    }
    Test(int i)
    {
        this(10.5);
        System.out.println("int-arg");
    }
    Test(double d)
    {
        System.out.println("double-arg");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Test t1 = new Test(); // double-arg, int-arg, no-arg
        Test t2 = new Test(10); // double-arg, int-arg
        Test t3 = new Test(10.5); // double-arg
        Test t4 = new Test(10l); // double-arg
    }
}

- for constructors, inheritance and overriding concepts are not applicable but overloading concept is applicable.
- every class in java including abstractor can contain constructors but interface cannot contain constructor.

# Note: If parent class contains any argument constructor then while child classes we have to take special care with respect to constructors.
# Whenever we are writing any argument constructor, it is highly recommanded to write no-arg constructor also.

e.g.
class P
{
    P() throws IOException
    {

    }
}

class C extends P
{

} // CE: unreported exception

e.g.
class P
{
    P() throws IOException
    {

    }
}

class C extends P
{
    C() throws IoException | Exception | Throwable 
    {
        super();
    }
} 

# Note: If parent class constructor throws any checked exception, child class constructor must throw the same checked exception or its parent. Otherwise the code won't compile.


# singleton class:
- For any java class, if we are allowed to create only one object such type of class is called singleton class.
e.g.
Runtime
BusinessDelegate
ServiceLocator

# Advantage of singleton class:
- If several people have same requirement, then it is not recommanded to create a separate object for every requirement.
- We have to create only one object and we can reuse the same object for every similar requirement so that performance and memory utilzation will be improved.
- This is the central idea of singleton classes.
